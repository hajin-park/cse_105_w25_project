Parsing the DFA:
The parse_dfa function reads a multi-line string where the first few lines specify the DFA’s components (states, alphabet, start, and accepting states) and the following lines list transitions. Each transition is stored in a dictionary with keys as (current_state, symbol).

Constructing the Intersection DFA:
The intersect_dfa function implements the standard Cartesian product construction. The states of the new DFA are ordered pairs from the two input DFAs. Its start state is the pair formed by the two start states, and a state is accepting if both components are accepting in the original DFAs. Transitions are defined by simultaneously following the transitions in both DFAs for each symbol in the common alphabet.

Emptiness Check:
The is_dfa_language_empty function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the intersection DFA’s start state. If it reaches an accepting state, then the language is nonempty, and the regular properties are consistent.

Overall Consistency Check:
The are_properties_consistent function ties the previous functions together: it parses the DFAs, constructs their intersection, and then checks if the intersection language is empty. A nonempty intersection means there exists at least one string satisfying both properties.

Demo Runs:
Two test cases are provided:

Test Case 1 (w0, w1): DFA for strings starting with 0 and DFA for strings starting with 1. Their intersection is empty, so the output is False.
Test Case 2 (x0, x1): DFA for strings that contain at least one 0 and DFA for strings that contain at least one 1. Their intersection contains strings with both a 0 and a 1, so the output is True.
